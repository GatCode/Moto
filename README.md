Due to the lack of financial support, the app is currently not available on the Apple App Store,

## About
Find specifications of your motorcycle quickly and easily, without reading the manual. Just point your phone onto your motorcycle, tap on detect and select your specific model.

Moto uses **Core ML** for high performance, reliable and fast image classification as well as **offline database technology**, such that you can get magnificent motorcycle specifications even when you are out on an adventure!

Please keep in mind that Moto is currently in **Beta** phase and, therefore, the majority of motorcycles displayed are **BMW motorcycles**. The support of all motorcycle brands and models will be implemented in future releases.

At the moment, the motorcycle detection feature only supports the following motorcycle models:  
- BMW K1  
- BMW K1100  
- BMW R25  
- BMW R80  
- BMW R1200  
- BMW S1000  
- HONDA CB400  

**Enjoy the freedom and flexibility of Moto - wherever you are!**
